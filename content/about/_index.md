Hi, my name is Cameron, and I use computers for fun and profit.

This is my personal blog where I mostly talk about doing things with computers, the occasional bit of obscure tech, and hobbies of mine.

This blog exists mostly for selfish reasons. I wanted a way to keep track of any research and technical things I find interesting, or just things I wanted to document as a way of solidifying and increasing my knowledge about them. Hopefully other people will find these posts helpful, relevant, or interesting. I believe that blogs are a two-way conversation, so I welcome your comments/feedback via email.

Unless you are a recruiter, or pushing some other unsolicited services, I welcome your non-spam email. To email me, perform the following replacement `s/cewood/cameronewood/g` on this  domain and add `me@` in front of it.
